# Sampling_Assignment
 I have used five sampling techniques on a 'credit card fraud detection' dataset and then applied five Machine Learning classification models on each sample to find out which 'Model&sampling technique' combination gives us the best accuracy.

5 sampling Techniques used are:

Simple Random Sampling \
Stratified Sampling\
Cluster Sampling\
Reservoir Sampling\
Systematic Sampling\
\
The Sample size was calculates using the following formula: n = Z^2(p(1 â€“ p)/m^2) where: n = sample size Z = z-value (for 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.96) p = proportion of the minority class (taken as 0.5 for a balanced dataset) m = margin of error (taken as 0.1 for a sample size of 1000)

 5 models applied are:

Naive Bayes\
Logistic Regression\
Decision tree classifier \
K nearest Neighbour\
Extra Tree Classifier 


 the Maximum Accuracy obtained is  98.96373056994818% using:

Extra Tree Classifier with all kind of sampling techniques.
